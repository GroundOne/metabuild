                        First, you will need to create a NEAR wallet and purchase NEAR tokens on an exchange.

                    <p className="py-2 text-lg text-black">
                        After that, you can purchase PART NFTs. For that you will need the contract address of a
                        project. A PART gives you priority access to buy or rent a property once the project is built.
                        Each PART has a ranking number.
                    </p>
                    <p className="py-2 text-lg text-black">
                        PARTs are either randomly distributed at Sale Opening Date if you register before the launch, or
                        you can purchase the highest ranked PART available after Sale Opening Date.
                    </p>
                    <p className="py-2 text-lg text-black">
                        If you already own a PART and your project is being built, go to the MANAGE section of the app
                        in order to select your favourite properties for the Property Distribution.

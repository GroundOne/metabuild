- does it make sense to have 2 different NFT Tokens in one contract?

### Technical / JS Contracts

**Token Transfer**

**Testing**

- Is it possible to get the environment infos inside the ava integration tests (maybe from near-workspaces?)

- advance time in js tests?

- is the randomize logic with `seed` sound or can be improved?

**Data Types / Variables**

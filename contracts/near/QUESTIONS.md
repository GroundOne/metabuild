### General

- is the randomize logic with `seed` sound or can be improved?

- which data types can be used? are there docs for it? (i128, strings?)

- how can I work with BigInts inside my contract?

  - for testing `near-workspaces` there's { NEAR } has some utility functions.
  - Does the near-sdk-js have equivalent functionality?
